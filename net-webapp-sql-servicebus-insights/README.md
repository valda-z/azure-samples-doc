# .NET Web App, SQL, DocumentDB, ServiceBus, Function Apps, Application Insights

Simple ToDo application which uses ASP NET MVC front end, data are stored in Azure SQL database and each new ToDo item is processed to Service Bus. From Service bus are messages processed by Function Apps which are connected to Service Bus events. Function Apps create new entries in DocumentDB which is used like a storage for "comments" record for each ToDo record.
